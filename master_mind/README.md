if you have no idea about this game pls visit this link to understand the rules https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game) 

This is an initial version of the game in which it require two player "Roller and Gueeser" 
the game is still underdevelopment and I'm planning to add another feature to allow the player to play with the computer in any of the rules he prefer
#the number of turns to guess right colors and order will be 12 only!!
#how the game will work
the guesser will be asked to chose from 7 default colors the roler had chossed 4 and according to his pick an array of 4 values will be printed.

true: means that this is the right color at the right position.

exist: means that the color exist but in another position.

false: means the color doesn't exist at all.
